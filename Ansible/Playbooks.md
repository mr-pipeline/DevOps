```
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --limit webservers
```

```
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --limit xyz.example.com
```

If you want to see a list of hosts that would be affected by your playbook before you actually run it, use `--list-hosts`:

```
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --list-hosts
```

You can explicitly define a remote user to use for remote plays using the `--user (-u)` option:

```
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --user=johndoe
```

In some situations, you will need to pass along your sudo password to the remote
server to perform commands via sudo. In these situations, youâ€™ll need use the
`--ask-become-pass (-K)` option. You can also explicitly force all tasks in a playbook
to use sudo with `--become (-b)`. Finally, you can define the sudo user for tasks run
via sudo (the default is root) with the `--become-user (-U)` option.

```
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --become --become-user=janedoe --ask-become-pass
```
